Yes, Stable Diffusion (SD) can generate images of different aspect ratios. By specifying different width and height dimensions during the generation process, you can adjust the aspect ratio of the output images.

Testing with "Metadata/No crop/2_nocrop.png":

You can use the depth map located at "Metadata/No crop/2_nocrop.png" to generate images of various aspect ratios. The height and width arguments in the image generation function allow you to set specific dimensions, thus altering the aspect ratio.

For example:

Aspect ratio 1:1: Set both height=512 and width=512 for a square image.
Aspect ratio 2:1: Set height=512 and width=1024 for a wider rectangular image.
Comment on Image Generation Quality:

Aspect Ratio 1:1: When generating images with a 1:1 aspect ratio (512x512), the image quality tends to be consistent and sharp. Since the Stable Diffusion model is often optimized for this square aspect ratio, images generally appear well-structured, with balanced compositions.

Non-Square Aspect Ratios: For aspect ratios other than 1:1 (e.g., 2:1 or 3:2), the generation quality may vary depending on the dimensions and the prompt. The model stretches or compresses the image to fit the dimensions, which can sometimes lead to slight distortions, loss of detail, or unnatural compositions in areas of the image. The depth map helps preserve structural integrity to some extent, but non-square ratios may still show minor artifacts.

In general, Stable Diffusion adapts well to different aspect ratios but may need further adjustments for the best results when working with extreme aspect ratios.
