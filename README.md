# Image Generation Using Stable Diffusion

## Purpose

This project utilizes the **Stable Diffusion** model to generate high-quality images based on provided text prompts and depth maps. The model allows for guided image generation, resulting in photo-realistic images that match user specifications. The implementation also explores the effects of aspect ratios on image generation quality and measures the latency of the generation process.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the environment and install the necessary libraries, execute the following commands:

```bash
pip install torch
pip install diffusers
pip install Pillow
pip install numpy
pip install torchvision
pip install tqdm
